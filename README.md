## JavaScript Parallax Logic

The JavaScript file controls the scrolling effects:

- The **moon, stars, mountains, and boat** move at different speeds when the user scrolls.
- The **title text** (`.dola`) grows in size until it reaches a fixed position.
- At a certain scroll threshold, the **background gradient changes** dynamically.
